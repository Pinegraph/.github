## Pinegraph’s mission is to enable everyone to become a creator.


Pinegraph was founded in 2022 by a group of senior FAANG engineers and UC Berkeley Alumni. Our belief is that everyone is innately creative and talented. Our goal is to help unlock that latent talent through revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence.

Launched in June of 2022, Doodles helps everyone create stunning visualizations just from a simple sketch and words. Through this we’ve been able to help everyone to turn their imaginations into reality whether that’s in the form of posters, t-shirts, canvases, cups, NFTs, and more.

In the near future, we plan to support capabilities for making visual stories, music, and recipes.

## Open source community

We're also a huge fan of the open source community. As a result, we'll gladly release re-usable constructs for people to create secure and reliable production level systems. Check out our pinned repositories for examples!
